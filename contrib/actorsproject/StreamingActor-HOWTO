How to use the Streaming Actor (art_Streaming)
=============================================

The streaming system actor is used to receive the streaming data from
network. The current implementation used TCP ptotocol as reliable 
connection. The TCP socket of the streaming system actor is configured
as server mode listening on the specific port. The default port is 12345 
and it is specified in nl file. Normally the streaming system actor 
should also be specified as active mode:

source = art_Streaming(activeMode=1,port=2000)

The streaming actor consists one output port that relay the streaming byte date 
as int32_t out.
