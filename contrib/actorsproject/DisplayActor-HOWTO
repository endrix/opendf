How to use the Display Actor (art_Display_yuv)
=============================================

1. Quickstart
The system actor art_Display_yuv is used to display video output in
the MPEG decoders that are provided as sample code (e.g. see
cal-examples/rvcdemo). Not to make the run-time system (libactors-rts)
dependent on windowing system etc, such code is compiled with the
application. Using the provided Makefiles
(e.g. cal-examples/rvcdemo/Makefile) you define one of the following
variables to select display "back end":

FB_DISPLAY   for output on /dev/fb0
GTK_DISPLAY  to use gtk+2.0
SDL_DISPLAY  to use SDL
NULL_DISPLAY to sink the yuv data without RGB-conversion and display

For instance to use SDL:

make SDL_DISPLAY=1 rvcDemo


2. Requirements

FB_DISPLAY   requires the frame-buffer device /dev/fb0
GTK_DISPLAY  depends on the libgtk-2.0 and libgtk-2.0dev packages
SDL_DISPLAY  depends on the libsdl1.2 and libsdl1.2-dev packages

3. Performance

Not very systematic benchmarking seems to indicate that FB_DISPLAY is
slightly faster than SDL_DISPLAY and a lot faster than GTK_DISPLAY.
Skipping RGB-conversion and display entirely (i.e. NULL_DISPLAY) is of
course the fastest.
