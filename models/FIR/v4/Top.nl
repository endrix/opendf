/**
	FIR v4 increases the granularity of FIR v3 by realizing a single execution
	unit (FIRcell) as a network of very simple actors, rather than a single
	atomic actor.
	
	The Top testbed instantiates the FIR along with a golden reference (FIR v1)
	and plots their output to the same noisy sine wave.
