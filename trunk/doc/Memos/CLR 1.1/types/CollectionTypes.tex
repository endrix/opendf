\section{Collection types}

\Cal contains syntax for constructing lists, sets, and maps. The
following describes the types pertaining to these objects.

{\em This section is preliminary, reflecting the current usage. We might want to change this depending on how we decide on the map type syntax.}
\subsection{Lists}

The type class for list types is {\tt list}, and it takes two optional
parameters: {\tt type} and {\tt size}. The {\tt type} parameter is
bound to a type, denoting the type of the elements in the list. The
{\tt size} parameter is bound to a non-negative integer, and denotes
the number of elements in the list.

\subsection{Maps}

TBD. {\em We cannot really use {\tt map} as the name of the type
  class, because {\tt map} is a keyword and can therefore not be an
  identifier, which would break the rule of type syntax.}

\subsection{Sets}

TBD. {\em We probably want to hold off on defining set types until we
  know what syntax to choose for map, and list, types.}
