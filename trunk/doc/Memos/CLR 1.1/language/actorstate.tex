\chapter{Actor state variables and initialization}\label{sect:StateVars}

The state of an actor is exactly that piece of information which is
stored between {\em firings}, and which the code associated with an
action can therefore use to influence the actions taken by future
firings.


\section{State variable declarations}

An actor may contain any number of state variable declarations at its
top level (cf. section \ref{sect:Variables} for details on variable
declarations). These variables are called {\em actor state variables}. One such declaration has the
following syntax:

\bgr

StateVarDecl : SimpleStateVarDecl ;
     | FunProcVarDecl.

SimpleStateVarDecl : Type~ID~[('\charColon=' | '=')~Expression] ;
     | [\kwMutable]~Type~ID~[('\charColon=' | '=')~Expression].

FunProcVarDecl : .

\egr

State variable names must be unique actor-wide, and may not coincide
with the names of actor parameters or ports, because they are defined
in the same scope. As a consequence, the expressions used to
define their initial values can refer to actor parameters, ports, and
any state variable, as long as this does not include any circular
dependencies (cf. section \ref{sect:VariableScoping}).
