actorsproject TODO

The idea is that this is a living document, change priority (move
between lists), add and delete as approriate.

Known issues
============
101. Integration of procedure calls doesn't work [SSAGenerator].
     ParseHeaders.cal in MPEG4_SP_Decoder provides an example.
106. Elaboration of non-existant actors should be an error.
     Currently, some weird $classname_0.calml is generated [actors-make]
109.
 
Desirable features
==================
204. Integration with opendf.cli (command-line interface)
205. Ability to disable transformations (particularly dead-code
     elimination -sometimes we want to keep useless actions)
210. Allow for libraries of actors (directory structure) [actors-make]
211. Control of buffer size for individual fifos [actors-make, runtime]
212. Use TRACE macros to record/dump traces [runtime]
215. Command-line options to control tracing etc. in runtime [runtime]
216. Add latency control to action scheduler (=maximum number of
     actions to fire before yielding) [Xlim2c, runtime]
219. Support for repeat input/output patterns [SSAGenerator]
222. Fixed-point support [opendf core, Xlim2c]
224.
  
Nice to have
============
301. Removal of if(1) [Xlim2c]
302. Constant folding of expressions [Xlim2c]
303. Ports and aggregate state variables should use smallest integral
     type possible [xlim2c and run-time]
305. Handle/accept actors with no effect (empty action scheduler)
     [xlim2c, run-time?]
306. Value numbering and removal of redundant re-evaluation [Xlim2c]
308. If-then-else pretty print (current indentation looks horrible)
     [xlim2c]
310. Better generation of expression trees -less temporaries [xlim2c]
311. Faster handling of trivial Xlim-patches (that do not require update
     of dependence graph) [xlim2c]
312. Sort/layout actor instances so that large aggregates are placed at
     the end [xlim2c]
313. Visualize XLIM (rather than generating compilable C)
314. Clean-up XLIM (XLIM-to-XLIM)
315. Avoid unnecssary parentheses in Xlim2c (operator precedence)
319. Check consistency between generated code and run-time system:
     (a) at compile time (b) at run-time (configuration of model).
320. Don't duplicate stuff that is found elsewhere in the source tree
     (a) MPEG4_SP_Decoder (used in actors-test) (b) the .jars
322. Use switch instead of if-then-else-if structures when appropriate
     (in particular this goes well with 321) [Xlim2c].
324. Static libactors-rts rather than .so
325. ENTRY/EXIT macros in action scheduler to facilitate local copies
     of ports.
