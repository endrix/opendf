
The XDF part of the tool chain deals with the netlist 
(represented in XDF format). It does two things:
(a) generate VHDL from the netlist,
(b) generate actor instances (in CalML) based on the 
    parameters in the netlist.

Both tasks share a common sequence of initial transformations, 
and differ only in the last step. 

1  These are the initial steps to be taken when processing
   netlists in XDF format:

	xdfInline.xslt 
    xdfPropagateConstants.xslt 
    xdfFlatten.xslt 
    xdfPropagateTypes.xslt
   	xdfCheckTypes.xslt
	xdfAnnotateDataWidth.xslt
	xdfAnnotateFanout.xslt
    xdfAddInstanceNames.xslt
    xdfInsertDefaultBufferSize.xslt
    xdfAnnotateBufferSize.xslt

2a The result of (1) is then processed into VHDL for the 
   netlist by the following transformation:

	xdfGenerateVHDL.xslt
    
2b The result of (1) is used to produce the actor instances by 
   this transformation:

	xdfCreateActorInstances.xslt
