Bugs/known issues
-----------------
106. Elaboration of non-existant actors should be an error.
     Currently, some weird $classname_0.calml is generated [actors-make]
     Johan (1d)

Reduce runtime overhead
-----------------------
104. Actors seem not to block as they should [Xlim2c+runtime?]
     - Come to a final conclusion/identify what needs to be done
       Charles, Patrik, Carl (start by a 3-day effort)
     - Analyse profiles, detect sources of overhead, propose solution
105. Generate code for both "wait on any" and "wait on all" [Xlim2c]
     Currently we always do wait on any, by which some actors are
     unblocked too early. (Now this only concerns non-deterministic
     actors and some actors with complex scheduling conditions).
     - Analyse, propose solution if possible... Carl (3-day start)

Tracing
-------
212. Use TRACE macros to record/dump traces [runtime]
     - Convert output to (XML?) format that we share with EFPL
       Patrik (1w)
218. Generate actor info, needed to produce action traces [Xlim2c]
     Carl (1w)

Support RVC MPEG
----------------
219. Support for repeat input/output patterns [SSAGenerator]
     - Prestudy Johan (1w)
     - Then we know what else is needed...

Floating-point support
----------------------
220. Floating-point support [Xlim2c]
     Carl (1w)
221. 64-bit tokens, optimization for all token-sizes [Xlim2c, runtime]
     Charles (2 days)


FIFOs
-----
211. Control of buffer size for individual fifos [actors-make, runtime]
     - Charles (2 days)
     - Johan (2 days)
214. Sources/sinks should write/read in chunks -not bytewise [runtime]
     a) Sources (simpler?), Charles (2 day) 
     b) Sinks, prestidy/design, (1w)

GTK
---
318. Add support for GTK in display system actor.
     Charles (5 days)
