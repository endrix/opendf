
The Mandelbrot examples contain a simple fractal generator, along with a 
number of actors that display, store, and retrieve the output generated by the 
fractal generator.

v1 contains two top-level models, TopMandelbrot and TopMandelbrotPartial, which
can be used to compute and display a representation of either the entire
Mandelbrot set or any part of it to a specified resolution. Note the use of 
external Java classes and methods in v1/Display.cal.

v2 contains three top-level models. TopComputeMandelbrot computes the interation 
count for a part of the number plane, and stores them in a file (note the use 
of the corresponding Java API in v2/WriteFile.cal). TopShow reads such a file
(again, note the use of Java in v2/ReadFile.cal), colors it, and displays it 
in a window. TopWritePNG reads the iteration counts, produces a colored image, 
and store that image in PNG format in a file (using Java image I/O in 
v2/WriteImage.cal).
