BUGS on actorsproject-vector branch

1. "Old" tests (Xlinx MPEG4_SP_Decoder) no longer passes
   Identify issues...

2. Local aggregates (Lists) require initializers to compile

3. Comprehensions with generators not supported

4. Multiple actions with identical "tags" result in multiple XLIM tasks
   that have the same name. Did this work properly in old SsaGenerator?
