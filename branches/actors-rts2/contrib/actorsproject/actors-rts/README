Available command-line options for built programs:

  --timing	run actors with timing measurements
  --info	print out some (currently rather uninteresting) info
  --single_cpu	run all actor on single cpu, if not all actors are
		given an affinity, system will fall-back to this mode
  --fifosize=N	use given fifosize (in bytes) as default
  --loopmax=N	maximum number of loops until an actor gives up
		execution
  --affinityN=comma_separated_list_of_actors	run the named
		actors on CPU N


Arguments to actors (from the .nl file), can be specified as $NAME, 
and then they are taken from the environment of the process.
