Welcome to the OpenDF project Wiki page.
This site will soon be updated to contain additional links and information about system design via the Open Dataflow (OpenDF) framework.

Eclipse Front End
Most features of the OpenDF technologies are accessible through the Eclipse IDE. Through Eclipse you can develop CAL actors and NL networks with the OpenDFEditor plugin which provides syntax highlighting, semantic checking and interactive error reporting. This plugin also provides access to the OpenDF interpreted simulator for testing and validating your design. The simulator is accessed through the Run dialog which provides access to various simulator options, specification of input and output files, and control over simulation logging.

Eclipse Install/Update Site
The OpendDF Eclipse plugins may be accessed via http://opendf.sourceforge.net/eclipse/
Detailed instructions for installing the Eclipse plugins under Eclipse 3.2 or later:
Select the menu item: Help->Software Updates->Find and Install
In the Install/Update window select "Search for new features to install" and click Next>
In the Install window click the "New Remote Site" button on the right hand side
In the "New Update Site" window enter "OpenDF Update Site" for the Name and http://opendf.sourceforge.net/eclipse for the URL
Back in the "Install" window be sure that the OpenDF Update Site box is checked (if it is the only one checked the following steps will be faster)
Click the Finish button
In the "Updates" window, check the box next to "OpenDF Update Site" and click Next>
Read and agree to the license agreements and click Next>
Click Finish
The plugin files will download and install. You will then have to restart Eclipse to enable the plugins

Using the plugins
To access the CAL/NL editor
Create a new project (eg a Java project) or be sure you are in an existing project.
Create a new file with the extension .cal or .nl. These files will automatically be associated with the OpenDF editor.

To access the OpenDF simulator:
Choose the Run->Open Run Dialog menu.
Double click the "dataflow simulation" entry on the left to create a new simulation configuration.
Give your run configuration a new name
Click the "Set from top model" button to navigate to your top level NL file.
Click Run and the simulation will start.
The red box in the progress window can be used to terminate a long running simulation once it has started.
