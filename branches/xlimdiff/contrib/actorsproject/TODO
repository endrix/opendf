actorsproject TODO

The idea is that this is a living document, change priority (move
between lists), add and delete as approriate.

Known issues
============
101. Integration of procedure calls doesn't work [SSAGenerator].
     ParseHeaders.cal in MPEG4_SP_Decoder provides an example.
102. Multi-token reads/writes: make sure there are no blocking pinReads/
     pinWrites [xlim2c or SSAGenerator]
103. Automatic generation of parameters to system actors
104. Actors seem not to block as they should [Xlim2c+runtime?]
105. Generate code for both "wait on any" and "wait on all" [Xlim2c]
     Currently we always do wait on any, by which some actors are
     unblocked too early.
106. Elaboration of non-existant actors should be an error.
     Currently, some weird $classname_0.calml is generated [actors-make]
107. elaborate.mk and makemodel.mk don't consider the time stamps of
     source files (other than the top-level model). Couldn't elaboration
     record dependences?
 
Desirable features
==================
204. Integration with opendf.cli (command-line interface)
205. Ability to disable transformations (particularly dead-code
     elimination -sometimes we want to keep useless actions)
206. Integrate SSAGenerator2 into the opendf.core code base
207. Traces and debug printouts from run-time: useful/understandable?
     Efficient when not used?
208. Couldn't we skip the elaboration (particularly CALML generation)
     of system actors; we just remove the CALMLs anyway? In particular,
     this would allow us to have proper MEMSIZE in the DDRModel
     (currently we fake it, since elaboration takes forever)
209. Support minimal rebuilds. One way could be to do light-weight
     elaboration (no CALML generation), record parameter values in
     separate files (one per actor), update parameter file only when
     values have changed and generate XLIM from .CAL + parameter file.
210. Allow for libraries of actors (directory structure) [actors-make]
211. Control of buffer size for individual fifos [actors-make, runtime]
212. Use TRACE macros to record/dump traces [runtime]
213. Tools to analyze (diff etc) and visualize traces.
214. Sources/sinks should write/read in chunks -not bytewise [runtime]
215. Command-line options to control tracing etc. in runtime [runtime]
216. Add latency control to action scheduler (=maximum number of
     actions to fire before yielding) [Xlim2c, runtime]
217. Support for multi-token writes in the same way as multi-token reads
     are handled (i.e. pinAvail) [SsaGenerator]
  
Nice to have
============
301. Removal of if(1) [Xlim2c]
302. Constant folding of expressions [Xlim2c]
303. Ports and aggregate state variables should use smallest integral
     type possible [xlim2c and run-time]
305. Handle/accept actors with no effect (empty action scheduler)
     [xlim2c, run-time?]
306. Value numbering and removal of redundant re-evaluation [Xlim2c]
307. Code motion/partial reduncancy elimination
308. If-then-else pretty print (current indentation looks horrible)
     [xlim2c]
309. if (complex-condition), while(complex-condition)
310. Better generation of expression trees -less temporaries [xlim2c]
311. Faster handling of trivial Xlim-patches (that do not require update
     of dependence graph) [xlim2c]
312. Sort/layout actor instances so that large aggregates are placed at
     the end [xlim2c]
313. Visualize XLIM (rather than generating compilable C)
314. Clean-up XLIM (XLIM-to-XLIM)
315. Avoid unnecssary parentheses in Xlim2c (operator precedence)
316. Don't generate the extra output called ssagenerator2.calml
     (used for debugging?). [SSAGenerator2]
317. The makefiles makemodel.mk and elaborate.mk should be stand-alone
     (useful if building w/o the top-level makefile). Check if
     definitions.mk has been included?
318. Add support for GTK in display system actor.
319. Check consistency between generated code and run-time system:
     (a) at compile time (b) at run-time (configuration of model).
320. Don't duplicate stuff that is found elsewhere in the source tree
     (a) MPEG4_SP_Decoder (used in actors-test) (b) the .jars
321. The HOT encoding of FSA states is inappropriate for s/w: use 
     a scalar encoding instead [SsaGenerator].
322. Use switch instead of if-then-else-if structures when appropriate
     (in particular this goes well with 321) [Xlim2c].
